Bookr
=====================================

A personal project to play with [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.org) (2.1). It is (or will be) a simple application for tracking books to replace my existing one.

The system uses a database for persistance of the book list and a RESTful interface for accessing the information.

There will be an HTML5/JavaScript front end for the UI. Eventually I hope to do different client implementations.

This application depends on the following other applications
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
